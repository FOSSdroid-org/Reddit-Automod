If you are not sure of the nature of an app, do not share or recommend it. To find out what constitutes FOSS or freedomware, [read this article](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html). To find out why proprietary software is bad, [read this article](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html). Proprietary software is dangerous because [it is often malware](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html). Have a splendid day!
